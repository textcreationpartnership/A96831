         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of all thoſe grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have opened the mouthes, and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the pens of Complainants, none can bee greater then to have our <hi>prayers</hi> turned into ſin. And yet this is done in effect, and by thoſe too, that would needs ſeeme Pillars of the Church. Their darke perſpective cannot ſurvey hearts, and yet mens devotions are doom'd by <hi>their</hi> act of Reprobation. 'Tis the common form is quarrel'd at, and through the paper ſides of
<pb facs="tcp:156949:3"/>
               <hi>that,</hi> they wound the chiefe (becauſe publike) pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of your pietie. Something I have written formerly upon this argument, that proved not altogether unſucceſſefull; What diſcharg'd it ſelfe then, under a private ſuperſcription, now requires a publike Dedication, and in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploreth Patronage: and whiles your Lordſhip holds up a ſhield before it, you do but the right of <hi>ſelfe defence</hi> to your owne conſcience; you do but vindicate the reputation (and how deare ſhould that be to you!) of your owne reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice of God.

For, as 'tis knowne you will not have a hand, ſo it may bee well preſum'd, that you would not willingly have your name in a cauſe that carries an appearance of injuſtice.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, before thou proceedeſt any further, let mee ſalute thee at the doore; and acquaint thee with two things for thy ſatisfaction. The firſt concernes the matter; the ſecond concernes the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>There are but two ſorts of evills in the world, the one of ſin; and the other of puniſhment, and both theſe are faſtned vpon our Liturgie. Some fly from it, that can winke (I am ſure) at grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appearances of evill; In their opinion it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to communicate in the vſe of it. Others (that would ſeeme to bee of a milder temper) would have this uſed rather as a rod of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> then as a rule of devotion. If any (though it pleaſe God to deny this ſupernaturall gift to him) prone inſufficient to diſcharge the duty of prayer in a conceived way; they<note n="*" place="margin">Smect. pag. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> would have it impoſed on him as a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> to vſe ſet formes and no other. A ſtrange thing that this wholeſome proviſion made for the advancement of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:156949:4"/>and the benefit of the people in their <hi>Regular</hi> ſervice of God, ſhould be turned into a Schedule of pennance for the ſhame of the Miniſter. By this wee may perceive what diseſteeme they have of a ſett forme of Prayer; But whither it be guiltie of ſo high a provocation, the enſuing diſcourſe will (as I ſuppoſe) determine. My confidence is not ſo <hi>tranſcendent,</hi> as theirs, that pretend a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord, for their aſſertions:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.25.</note> 
               <hi>Yet I give my judgement as one that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy of the Lord</hi> [hitherto] <hi>to bee faithfull.</hi> Sure I am, our <hi>Liturgie</hi> hath paſſed the muſter often, and <hi>marched</hi> thorow a field of <hi>vntainted</hi> blood, under the conduct of many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Martyrs: And 'tis pitty goodneſſe ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worſe reputed for being of a diffuſiue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet we ſee <hi>Manna,</hi> of a heavenly deſcent, and at firſt accordingly entertained, with the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affections of delight and admiration, even this, when twas growne <hi>common</hi> (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding miniſtred by the hands of <hi>Angels</hi>) became <hi>loathſome;</hi> Howbeit the change was not in the <hi>bread,</hi> but in them that gather'd it. We ſee Gods <hi>Attributes</hi> are never the leſſe glorious, becauſe <hi>communicable.</hi> But our comfort is (and yet it ſhould be our ſorrow alſo) that ſome of thoſe which except againſt our Liturgy, are not very wel affected, to that <hi>prayer</hi> of our Lords owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. It were to gather grapes of thornes, to expect their liking unto any that are not wound up with
<pb facs="tcp:156949:4"/>their owne <hi>key,</hi> and made tunable to their <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> Whole Squadrons of <hi>Quaeres</hi> are ſet in <hi>battell array</hi> againſt us; but I hope thoſe ſhall never ſo much triumph over reaſon, as to lead the publike <hi>formes</hi> of our devotion captiue. If eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry triviall claime were a good <hi>plea,</hi> againſt thoſe that are ſetled in poſſeſsion, we ſhould then haue no petitions but for warrants of ejection. 'Tis true a fardle of grievances have of late been extracted out of the booke of common prayer; but 'tis with as much faith, and as good ſucceſſe, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſtone is by the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> Yet this blaze (kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of Stubble not worth the gathering vp to the ſcandall of our <hi>Religion</hi>) hath warm'd and ſtrengthned the hands of our adverſaries, that were before enfeebled, and by the light hereof, they ſee into the diſtempers of mens boſomes to their advantage.</p>
            <p>Two daies are not yet expired, ſince I heard a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> vpbraid the folly and injuſtice of one of <hi>this</hi> way, that they did inflict puniſhments vpon the <hi>Catholiques</hi> with ſeverity for not frequenting that <hi>Service</hi> of the Church, which themſelves diſguſted. Thoſe paſſages at which offence is taken, are not ſo conſiderable, that we ſhould need to fire the beacon upon their diſcovery, as if a whole <hi>army</hi> of Church-trained ſouldiers were to be raiſed to encounter them (though I confeſſe, in other reſpects, this might be very vſefull.) The
<pb facs="tcp:156949:5"/>honourable houſe of Peeres hath ſet a watch<note n="*" place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for Religion.</note> of ſo many flaming eyes piercing into every quarter, tha. 'tis ſcarce poſsible any <hi>ſcruple</hi> ſhould eſcape vnweighed. Whoſoever ſtumbles at the ſtone of ſcandall, may there finde hands enough, both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and of abilitie to remove it. Me thinks this might be a <hi>ſuper ſedeas</hi> to all paper quarrells, that they have the Soveraigne hornes of ſuch a ſacred <hi>Altar</hi> to repaire unto for Sanctuary, where all doubts may as well have a calme, as they ſhall have a juſt tryall. Wee doe ſee the honourable Court hath done the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call letter</hi> juſtice, for whereas it had worne black too long, (for the funerall of that Sabbath, which was not dead but ſlept) now it is reinveſted in a <hi>feſtivall</hi> robe of ſcarlet. And other things abuſ'd, if they find no redreſſe here, will appeale and cry to a higher throne for vengeance. That <hi>Liturgy</hi> which hath beene ſent of ſo many ſacred meſſages to heaven, and ſo often had <hi>Audience</hi> with the Almighty, does their errand daily, who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to her imployment, and will bee as ready to joyne with the word<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn. 12.48.</note> in their judgement hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is now to co-operate in the worke of their Salvation.

His modeſty was not of proofe to reſiſt, or at leſt not of ability to prevaile againſt that importunity that aſſaulted him; therefore looke vpon it, but as upon a poore ſpoile that ſtrength hath forced from weakneſſe. Perhaps thou wilt not find every knot vntied here: The Author knew that hath been performed by ſundry hands of more skilfull dexterity.

               <p>But we have a more ſure word of prophecie to confirme us, might <hi>Aaron</hi> or his ſons bleſſe the people as their owne fancy led them? they might not, there's a forme extant of Gods own preſcription, and a ſtrict charge laid upon them to obſerve it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.22. &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes,</hi> [ther's the Author,] <hi>Speake vnto Aaron, and unto his ſonnes, ſaying, on this wiſe yee ſhall bleſſe the children of Iſrael, ſaying vnto them,</hi> [then comes the forme) <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee and keepe thee: The Lord make his face ſhine vpon thee, and be gracious vnto thee.

               <p>If we take the wings of our thoughts and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> we ſhall find that thoſe <hi>burning lamps of zeale,</hi> the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God, never ring thoſe changes in their devotions.

               <p>But to produce evidence beyond exception, our Saviour himſelf preſcrib'd a form that was alwaies had in veneration, elſe the <hi>Canker-fret</hi> of ſuperſtition could never have eaten ſo deepe into it.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayed thrice againſt one infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and if wee pray for the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> why may we not uſe the <hi>ſame</hi> words?

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26.44.</note> Why ſhould the holy Ghoſt tell us this, if it were not for our inſtruction? Let a man uſe the oldeſt formes of prayer extant (if no prejudice lye againſt his perſon, and his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be undiſcovered in this tryall) and you will find they ſound as well in your eares, and I am perſwaded in Gods to, as thoſe extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ones, which pretend the prerogative of a free Spirit.</p>

               <p>You doe but put your ſelfe into more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Chaines,</hi> while you ſeeke to obtaine your <hi>libertie.</hi> Let a man poure out his ſoule with never ſo much <hi>freedome,</hi> vet his words to others are a ſtinted <hi>forme,</hi> and ſet limits to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitioners that aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Doe you thinke that God ſheds and infuſeth the Spirit of ſupplication into all his Saints in that meaſure that he did the gift of prophecie into the Apoſtles? That's a priviledge proper to his extraordinary miniſters, whom he furniſht with immediate and infallible inſpiration. The miniſters of the Church that waite in <hi>Ordinary,</hi> have no gifts conferred upon them, that exempt them from meanes, <hi>meditation,</hi> and <hi>induſtry,</hi> much leſſe can others of the Saints pretend to ſuch an abſolute aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>'Tis confeſt that a <hi>Habit</hi> of prayer may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by uſe and exerciſe, and this is the holy <hi>uſury,</hi> by which we make a <hi>gaine</hi> of grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.

               <p>We buſie our thoughts to ſumme up and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt our wants before we addreſſe our ſelves to our devotion, and why not our <hi>words alſo?</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt we know not what to aske, and ſo are apt to run beyond our line of ſobriety, with the Sons of <hi>Zebedee, Mat.</hi> 20.22. without the latter we know not how to aske, and ſo ſtand upon equall tearmes of exigence with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples when they beſought Chriſt to preſcribe a <hi>forme</hi> for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1.</p>
               <p>'Tis the work of the ſpirit to give the <hi>affection,</hi> rather then the <hi>utterance</hi> of prayer, we have tongues of our owne, we want but a <hi>gracious affection,</hi> to imploy them. Grace doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, nor exempt, but perfects nature.

But I doe not remember hee is any where ſaid to give the <hi>tongue,</hi> though he be ſaid to give the Spirit of ſupplication. And this Spirit helps <hi>the infirmities</hi> of our hearts rather then thoſe of our language.</p>
               <p>The Meſſengers of God are aſſiſted by the Spirit as well in preaching as in <hi>prayer,</hi> and yet we ſee their beſt Sermons <hi>are ſet,</hi> or <hi>written ones.</hi> God will have his <hi>Prophet eate</hi> the Roule, before he utters it. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.1.

A prayer that hath a blind eye, a a lame hand, a ſuperfluous tongue, or any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted member in it, is not a fit oblation for the Almighty.

And upon diſcovery of the infection, hee was to command them to take away the ſtones in which the plague was, and put other in their places, and to cauſe the wals to be ſcraped and plaiſtered with other morter.

                  <hi>We found mighty and vehement informations,</hi> (ſuch as thoſe in theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times) <hi>ſupported with ſo weake and ſlender proofes, as it appeareth unto us and our Councell, that there was no cauſe why any change ſhould have been at all in that which was moſt impugned, the book of Common Prayer, containing the forme of the publike ſervice of God here eſtabliſhed, neither in the doctrine which appeared to be ſincere, nor in the formes and rites, which were juſtified out of the practice of the primitive Church.

                  <hi>who would have made a reaſonable conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: but for that in a matter concerning the ſervice of God, we were nice or rather jealous; that the publike forme thereof, ſhould bee free, not onely from blame, but from ſuſpition, ſo as neither the common adverſary ſhould have advantage to wreſt ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, to other ſenſe then the Church of England intendeth, nor any troubleſome or ignorant perſon of this Church, be able to take the leaſt occaſion of cavill againſt it.</hi>

            <p>To give you but one inſtance: In <hi>Churching</hi> of women, when the Miniſter hath ſaid, <hi>O Lord ſave this woman thy ſervant;</hi> the Clarke anſwers,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:156949:31"/>
               <hi>which putteth her truſt in thee;</hi> would any head imagine (beſides L. H'es) that the Clarke tels the Miniſter, the woman putteth her truſt in him, or when the Miniſter ſaies, <hi>Bee thou to her a ſtrong Tower,</hi> would any man, that hath ſo much as common ſenſe, ſuppoſe that this ſaying had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Clarke; as if hee were to bee a <hi>tower</hi> to her? 'Tis an old caveat, <hi>Noli ludere cum ſacris.</hi> Our Saviour calleth them ſwine that will turne, and rent thoſe, that have caſt pearles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. If men would have us comply with them, let them lay aſide their <hi>maliciouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſiniſter interpretations,</hi> and make their <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>weakneſſe</hi> their <hi>plea</hi> to draw us, which are like to bee the ſtrongeſt, and (in Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion) ſhould be the only motives.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as the Idolizing of our <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> (and not the Idolizing of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> only) is the maine ground of theſe, and many other jarres, I ſhall for the conviction of ſome, the ſatisfaction of others, and the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, adde the opinion of ſome learned and judicious Divines, (&amp; ſuch as are, as I thinke beyond exception) to this purpoſe: firſt</p>
            <p>Herein alſo many men doe erre, becauſe as though their liberty ſhould not bee ſound and ſafe, unleſſe it had men witneſſes of it, they doe undiſcreetly, and unwiſely uſe it. By which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable uſing, they many times offend the weake brethren, <hi>(ſo that there is offence on one ſide as well as on the other, which is now a dayes not conſidered, as if but one ſort of men
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:156949:31"/>could be offended.</hi> You may ſee at this day, ſome which thinke that their liberty cannot ſtand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they take poſſeſſion of it by eating of fleſh on Friday. I blame not that they eat, but this falſe opinion muſt be driven out of their minds. For they ought to thinke, that by their liberty, they obtaine no new thing in the ſight of men, but before God; and that it ſtandeth as well in abſtaining as in uſing If they underſtand, that it maketh no matter before God, whether they eat fleſh or egges, whether they weare red or blacke garments, that is enough. The conſcience is now free, to which <hi>(and not ſo much to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man)</hi> the benefit of ſuch liberty was due. Therefore although they doe afterward abſtain all their life long from fleſh, and weare alway but one colour, yet they are no leſſe free. Yea therefore becauſe they are free, they doe with a free conſcience abſtaine. Thus M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> which ſpeech of his, if it were well conſidered and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, would put an end to the controverſies about kneeling at the Sacrament, and almoſt all other differences of that nature amongſt us. The other Author I promis'd is Doctor <hi>Saunderſon,</hi>

            <p>The whole Booke I will reduce to three heads. 1. Somethings that ſeeme to make againſt our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie. 2. Somethings that make for it. 3.

               </note>. That the Pope never had any ſuch affection to our Liturgie (ſetting aſide his then hope of advantage) appeares in that he having given ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his children licence to read the Bible, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allowed to any of them the uſe of our Liturgie. Whence we may gather that in the Popes opinion the Bible is fitter to nouriſh them in their Poperie then our Liturgie.</p>
            <p>In his ſecond Chapter,<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>2.</hi> Pag. <hi>6,</hi> &amp;c.</note> the Author deſcends to the parts of the common prayer, following the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that is made of the Maſſe. But truly, I can finde nothing in it, that ought to impeach the credit
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:156949:35"/>of our Liturgie. For the <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> the <hi>Introibo ad Altare, &amp;c.</hi> Let them anſwer who are concerned in them. But if our Liturgie have ſpoken evill (it was the ſpeech of Trueth for himſelfe) beare witneſſe of the evill: but if well, why ſhould it be ſmitten with any ſlanderous tongue or pen? 2. The Author ſeemes to condemne ſome things, becauſe they are not ſo ancient. If his reaſon be good, it will hold much ſtronger againſt any forme that ſhall be newly deviſed. 3. If ſuperſtitious Romaniſts have given fooliſh reaſons for the uſe of many things in their Church, this cannot in equity he imputed to our Liturgie, wherein the goodneſſe of every prayer (cleare in it ſelfe) is ſufficient to juſtifie the uſe of it. And hence we may ſee how much the fingers of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>reaſon</hi> are too ſhort when they come to ſcanne the things that appertaine to God and godlineſſe. The reſt I leave to the judgement of the Reader.</p>
            <p>In his third Chapter he findes no leſſe then three abuſes in the Epiſtles. Firſt,<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>3.</hi> Pag. <hi>19.</hi>
               </note> becauſe againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> the Epiſtles are ſet before the Goſpels. 1. I know not what order he means. The word of God hath given no order (to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance) that the Goſpell ſhould be read before the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> (and both cannot be read firſt.) If he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that <hi>order</hi> of binding them up, I conceive the <hi>Ancients</hi> cauſed it ſo to be ordered for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> And the <hi>Church</hi> may for the like reaſon order, that in the reading, the <hi>Goſpell</hi> ſhould be uſhered in with an <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> 2. If the <hi>Author</hi> were put to that ſtreight, that he ſhould have but one part of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> I am perſwaded that he would
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:156949:36"/>preferre the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of our Saviour, and yet I ſhould have more charity in mee then to conclude (in his words) That hereby, The Epiſtle was contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly debaſed, but the Goſpell ſuperſtitiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.<note place="margin">

            <p>A ſecond abuſe is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 20.</note> (and ſurely 'tis a great one) that the <hi>Acts, Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. are ſtiled <hi>Epiſtles:</hi> and ſurely he abuſed the Scripture very much, that ſaid, It was the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of Almighty God ſent to his Church.</p>
            <p>The third abuſe is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 21.</note> that never a full paſſage is read, but a ſhred. And I pray why? Why, becauſe wee begin after the beginning of a Chapter. And truly he might have ſaid as much of a Chapter, if he had pleaſed, that it is but a <hi>ſhread</hi> (though I dare not ſay ſo) for all men know, the holy Pen-men of the Scriptures did not divide their Writings into Chapters, but it was done afterwards, and we ſee that men have differed too in the diviſion of them: and I ſee no reaſon, but any particular Church may appoint, what portions of Scripture ſhe thinks fitteſt to be read at ſeverall times. Now whereas he ſayes there is not a full paſſage read, becauſe they cut off before the end of a Chapter, I would faine have any man inſtance in any one <hi>Epiſtle</hi> or <hi>Goſpel,</hi> where the ſenſe ſhuts not up as fully as the 21 Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> doth. As for the Goſpel in particular I ſay but two things. 1. That hee may finde better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the choiſe of them, then conformity with <hi>Sarum,</hi> if hee would take the paines to conſult with <hi>Hooker</hi> who hath abundantly anſwered all cavels about the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> 2. If there be any fooliſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions in the heads of ſome men about the Goſpel,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:156949:36"/>we muſt not ſo farre runne into prophaneneſſe, as to make the Goſpel guilty of it, nor faulty for it; for upon ſuch grounds wee ſhould ſhortly have cauſe to abandon our whole <hi>Bible</hi> as well as our Liturgie.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:156949:39"/>Popish conſecration. Me thinks our Liturgie might take up the words of our Saviour againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Many good works have I shewed you, for which of them doe you ſtone me?</p>
            <p>Touching the third part (which I made of the book) a Diſcoverie of errours, I shall heartily joyn in evidence with the Author, and ſue for Juſtice. But yet I muſt profeſſe, that notwithſtanding all that is demonſtrated againſt it, I can ſee no reaſon, but that all thoſe moſt abominable paſſages of the Maſſe may in good reaſon be refuſed, <hi>and abhorred too,</hi> by thoſe that doe cordially embrace the [English] Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.</p>
            <p>Lord we beſeech thee to keepe thy Church and houſehold continually in thy true Religion, that they, which doe leane onely upon the hope of thy heavenly grace, may evermore be defended by thy mighty power, through Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
